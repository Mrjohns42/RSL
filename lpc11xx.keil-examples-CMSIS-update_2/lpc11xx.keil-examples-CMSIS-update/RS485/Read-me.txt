Purpose:
To implement RS458 protocol on LPC11xx

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Setup UART for 115.2K, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Note:
To get the test result, program the boards with both TX and RX program, 
power up the board with the RX program first, start the debugger on the
board with the RX program, power up the board with the TX program, stop 
the debugger, and check the content of the UARTBuffer on the RX program,
it should be the same as seen on UARTTxBuffer, 0x01-0x02-0x03....
