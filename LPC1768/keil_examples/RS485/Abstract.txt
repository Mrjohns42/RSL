The RS485 project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' evaluation board.

TO test RS485, program one board with RS485_RX to 1(RX), one
board with RS485_RX to 0(TX). reset TX board to send out a string
with a RS485 slave address first, and then check the content of 
UARTBuffer in the RX board.
 
Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
