This example is used to test the LPC 1768 I2C interface,
and the slave is I2C temp. sensor LM75A.

The temp value will be stored in I2CMasterBuffer byte 3, 4. 


Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
