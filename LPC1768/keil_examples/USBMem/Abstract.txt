The Memory project is a demo program for the LPC1768
using Keil MCB1700 board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  72 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  18 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCB1700: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper D-, D+ to DEVICE

By default, DMA is used. The attached dma.sct scatter file
is needed under the Keil MDK. If DMA is NOT used, modify the
project under Keil MDK, don't use the dma.sct but use defined 
target memory layout.
