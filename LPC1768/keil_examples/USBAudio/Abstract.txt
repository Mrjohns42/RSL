The Audio project is a demo program for the Keil MCB1700
Board using the NXP LPC17xx Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Audio Device - Speaker.

The USB Audio Device is recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Audio driver and add a
speaker which can be used for sound playback on the PC.
Potenciometer on the board is used for setting the Volume.

The Audio program is available for the following targets:
  MCB1700 Board: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                 (used for production or target debugging)

Since DMA is used for ISO communication, the USB RAM
is allocated for DMA purposes. A scatter file, dma.sct, is 
used in the Keil project file.
