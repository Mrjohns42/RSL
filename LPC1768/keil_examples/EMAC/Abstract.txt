This project is migrated from Keil MCB1700 Demo code.
It can run at Keil MCB1700 board with LPC17xx.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz

Due to a bug in the LPC175x family(80 pin package) that 
MDIO and MDC are not functioning correctly. A bit-banging 
on the MDIO and MDC are included in the driver. Setting 
MDC_MDIO_WORKAROUND to 1 will enable the bit-banging in 
both MDC and MDIO.

For board euipped with 80-pin LPC175x, some jumper setting
is necessary for EasyWEB demo. 
    Close "E/U" jumper(near USB Device/Host) on 2 and 3.
    Close "E/C" jumper(Near CAN connector) on 2 and 3.

The web page shows the values of analog input(AN2).
This tiny webserver needs very little resources and therefore has
some restrictions:
- only one active TCP session at any one time
- no support for fragmented IP datagrams
- no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
- only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.

The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
It is only available in German language. 

The easyWEB project is set up for one target:
  FLASH:  Settings for Keil MCB1700 Board. 
            Program code is loaded into on-chip flash
