The GPIO project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' evaluation board, and 
demonstrating the usage of the BOD.

LEDs P2.2-2.6 will continously blink while in active mode.

During stage-1 BOD (Vdd(reg)(3v3) typically <= 2.2V)
LED connected to P1.31 will blink rapidly. This indicates
that the BOD interrupt handler is being executed.

During state-2 BOD (Vdd(reg)(3v3) typically <= 1.85V)
The BODR bit in the RSID register is set. Once Vdd(reg)(3V3)
has recovered from brownout, the LED connected to P1.29
is set.

To test this project, a variable external power supply
is required. It is attached onto the MCB1700's VDDREG jumper.


Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
